## Missing USER-FACING FEATURES from Svelte Port

### Major Missing Features
1. [ ] ReadmePanel - Show README.md content in directory views
2. [ ] LiveVideo - Streaming video playback from merkle tree with MediaSource API
3. [ ] Yjs Document Editor - Collaborative rich text editing with Tiptap (partially done - needs delta storage)
4. [ ] GitRepoView - Git repository visualization (commits, branches, diff)
5. [ ] DosBox - DOS emulator for running .exe files in browser

### Missing UI Features
6. [ ] WalletPanel - Full wallet UI (mint management, mnemonic backup, send/receive)
7. [ ] SettingsPanel - Advanced settings (relay config, pool settings)
8. [ ] StreamPanel - Live streaming controls
9. [ ] MobileSearch - Responsive search that expands on mobile
10. [ ] LIVE indicator - Show when viewing live-updating directory

### Already Working (verified)

- [x] Toolbar/Share/Copy - ShareModal and CopyText components (9 tests passing)
- [x] Recents - Recently visited trees stored in localStorage (5 tests passing)
- [x] Stats - IndexedDB store stats available via idbStore
- [x] File selection and viewing - Works via URL routing
- [x] Path type detection - looksLikeFile() utility handles this
- [x] Delayed loading - Implemented inline in Viewer.svelte
- [x] Recently changed pulse - recentlyChanged store implemented

[x] 1. ReadmePanel - find/display README.md in directory view (2 tests passing)
[ ] 2. MobileSearch - responsive search expansion
[ ] 3. LIVE indicator - real-time directory updates
[ ] 4. StreamPanel - stream controls
[ ] 5. SettingsPanel - advanced settings
[ ] 6. WalletPanel - full wallet UI
[ ] 7. LiveVideo - MediaSource streaming (complex)
[ ] 8. GitRepoView - git visualization (complex)
[ ] 9. Yjs Document Editor - complete delta storage (complex)
[ ] 10. DosBox - DOS emulation (complex, external dependency)
