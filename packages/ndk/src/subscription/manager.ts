   *
   * This is the single place in the codebase that matches
   * incoming events with parties interested in the event.
   *
   * This is also what allows for reactivity in NDK apps, such that
   * whenever an active subscription receives an event that some
   * other active subscription would want to receive, both receive it.
   *
   * TODO This also allows for subscriptions that overlap in meaning
   * to be collapsed into one.
   *
   * I.e. if a subscription with filter: kinds: [1], authors: [alice]
   * is created and EOSEs, and then a subsequent subscription with
   * kinds: [1], authors: [alice] is created, once the second subscription
   * EOSEs we can safely close it, increment its refCount and close it,
   * and when the first subscription receives a new event from Alice this
   * code will make the second subscription receive the event even though
   * it has no active subscription on a relay.
   * @param event Raw event received from a relay
   * @param relay Relay that sent the event
   * @param optimisticPublish Whether the event is coming from an optimistic publish
